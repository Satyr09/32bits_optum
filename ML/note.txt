Procedure:-

1)Cleaning:-
	a)We first convert the data given in .txt files to more usable csv files.
	b)After that we calculate many features mean and median to canculate important features of the time series data
	and add them in the csv file along with static data
	c)we then delete the columns having more than 400 missing values 
	d)we also parse the data from result.txt and add it to our main csv file
2)Analysis:-
	a)Firstly we tried to fit the data directly to few models but after grid-search
	we could not increace acc more than 83% also the false negetive rate was high
	b)For this purpose we further divide the data to 4 types based on icu types
	c)By doing this we increase the mean acc upto 86% and also reduced the false negative rates
	d)For reducing false negetive we also used () to sythetically generate data and reduce the imbalance
	e)We used grid search to find optimal number of features and tune their parameters to get the best result
3)Result:-
	acc:-86.45% in set b
	By employing the above methods we were also able to find out key factors to look for each type of patient(icy_type)
	
	for type-I
		gcs,creatinine,bun,urine
	for type-II
		gcs,bun,creatinine,urine,glucose,sodium
	for type-III
		creatinine,bun,gcs,glucose,urine
	for type-IV
		creatinine,gcs,platelate,age,heart-rate,bun
